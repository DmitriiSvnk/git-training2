Hear the devil callin, hear the devil callin
When I hear the devil callin' God will pay him for what he's do
I can't stop the Dogs of War, I can't stop the Dogs of War
See the feels burnin, see the feels burnin'
When I see the feels burnin cause hell is coming through
I can't stop the Dogs of War, I can't stop the dogs of war
Feel the river risin, feel the river risin
